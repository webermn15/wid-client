# What I Do

----
### A light application for staying on task and reflecting on your productivity
*The micro helper to accomodate your macro visions*

Instead of setting big huge goals and marking your progress along the way, **What I Do** focuses on how you manage your daily routine. Create tasks, track when you start and stop them, and reflect on your satisfaction with your performance.

* Set periodic push reminders to check if you're still on task
* Keep a consistent record of how you've spent your day
* Record notes, reflections, and view visualizations of your activity

### This is the client-side application, built in React

WID's client manages state using **state management tool** and consumes a Python Falcon API **link here**
